    "1. Which keyword is used to create a function? Create a function to return a list of odd numbers in therange of 1 to 25.\n",
    "ans:The keyword used to create a function is \"def.\" Here's a short Python function that returns a list of odd numbers in the range of 1 to 25:\n",

    "def get_odd_numbers():\n",
    "    odd_numbers = [num for num in range(1, 26) if num % 2 != 0]\n",

    "2. Why *args and **kwargs is used in some functions? Create a function each for *args and **kwargsto demonstrate their use.\n",
    "ans: *args is used to pass a variable number of non-keyword (positional) arguments to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **kwargs is used to pass a variable number of keyword arguments (as a dictionary) to a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Here are simple examples to demonstrate their use:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   \n",
    "   # Example for *args\n",
    "def sum_numbers(*args):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for num in args:\n",
    "        total += num\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "\n",
    "result = sum_numbers(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "print(result)  # Output: 15\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example for **kwargs\n",
    "def print_info(**kwargs):\n",
    "    for key, value in kwargs.items():\n",
    "        print(f\"{key}: {value}\")\n",

    "# Output:\n",
    "# name: John\n",
    "# age: 25\n",
    "# city: New York\n",
    "In the sum_numbers function, *args allows you to pass any number of arguments, and they are treated as a tuple. In the print_info function, **kwargs allows you to pass any number of keyword arguments, and they are collected into a dictionary.\n",

    "3. What is an iterator in python? Name the method used to initialise the iterator object and the methodused for iteration. Use these methods to print the first five elements of the given list [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14,16, 18, 20].\n",
    "ans: \n",
    "In Python, an iterator is an object that allows you to iterate over a sequence of elements, one at a time. It keeps track of the current state during iteration.To initialize an iterator object, you use the iter() method, and to iterate over the elements, you use the next() method.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can print the first five elements of the given list using iterators:\n",
    "\n",
    "my_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20]\n",
    "\n",
    "# Initialize iterator object\n",
    "my_iterator = iter(my_list)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Iterate and print the first five elements\n",
    "for _ in range(5):\n",
    "    element = next(my_iterator)\n",
    "    print(element)\n",
    "This code snippet initializes an iterator for the list and then uses a loop to call next() five times, printing each element in the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a generator function in python? Why yield keyword is used? Give an example of a generator function.\n",
    "ans:A generator function in Python is a special type of function that allows you to iterate over a potentially large sequence of data without generating the entire sequence in memory at once. It uses the yield keyword to produce a series of values one at a time, allowing the function to pause and resume its execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The yield keyword is used to produce a value from the generator function and temporarily suspends its execution. This is useful for memory efficiency, especially when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences, as only one value is generated and processed at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a simple example of a generator function:\n",
    "\n",
    "def count_up_to(limit):\n",
    "    count = 1\n",
    "    while count <= limit:\n",
    "        yield count\n",
    "        count += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using the generator function\n",
    "for number in count_up_to(5):\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "In this example, the count_up_to generator function produces numbers from 1 to the specified limit. The yield statement is used to yield each number one at a time, allowing the loop to iterate over the generated values without storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
    "5. Create a generator function for prime numbers less than 1000. Use the next() method to print the first 20 prime numbers.\n",
    "ANS:\n",
    "def is_prime(num):\n",
    "    return num > 1 and all(num % i != 0 for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1))\n",
    "\n",
    "def generate_primes():\n",
    "    num = 2\n",
    "    while num < 1000:\n",
    "        if is_prime(num):\n",
    "            yield num\n",
    "        num += 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# Print the first 20 prime numbers\n",
    "prime_generator = generate_primes()\n",
    "for _ in range(20):\n",
